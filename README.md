## Introduction
This HR analytics project focuses on analyzing Employee data within a fictional company. Our goal is to uncover insights that answer key questions and guide data-driven decisions.  

By employing descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analysis, we aim to summarize employee data, understand the work force composition, determine employee performance and job satisfaction level, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.   

Through this analysis, we seek to make informed decisions regarding promotions and retrenchments, as well as implement strategies to improve overall performance and job satisfaction among employees.
